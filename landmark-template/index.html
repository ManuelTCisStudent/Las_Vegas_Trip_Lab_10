                        <p>Through my early life, I was aware of Las Vegas as the city to go for gambling related
                            reasons, but nothing else beyond that. So it was quite a thrill to have my family decide to
                            use our summer vacaction to Las Vegas, even if it wasn't sure what would be fun over there
                            as a 12 year old. Likewise, making our way to the city had driven me insane with boredom as
                            desert scenario became all to common on the car ride there. However, once settling in the
                            view of the city and the large sign indicated the city's name, I knew I wouldn't forget my
                            vacation at Las Vegas.</p>

                        <p>Our first destination for the first half of our vacation would be at the Circus Circus hotel,
                            which even as I child knew it was a place designed to be more child-friendly with its brand.
                            However that didn't stop me from running around the place, looking around the playareas, and
                            watching the various different circus theme attractions catch my eye. Of course, even my
                            parents seemed to be having a blast within this all new and different enviroment. So this
                            hotel is quite a special place in my heart, espcially after we won ourserves a large fluffy
                            plush polar bear doll.

                        <p>Our second hotel place to stay was the Excalibur hotel, which at the time, seemed to deepen
                            my spirits as the overall design of the place was pretty cool, it lacked the colorfull flare
                            of our first hotel. However, while the hotel lacked the excitement of the last place, I did
                            managed to find myself enjoying the place through the better tasting selection of food's
                            present within the hotel and the smaller entertainment center. However most importantly, the
                            overall location of the hotel allowed us to explore a more varied collection of famed
                            destination within the city, and we managed to gather so many different memories from our
                            more laxed way of traveling on foot.

                        Through this history rewind, I discussed my own personal history within the acclaimed city (even
                        if not acclaimed for the best reasons), however despite my well spoken words about the city, I
                        ultimately ended up with my first visit as my seemingly last visit. Back in the day, our family
                        actually the freedom and money to go on this pretty cool trip, but recent years haven't been too
                        kind on our fiancial situation and likewise, we don't have the time to actually freely spend on
                        heading out of state due to school, jobs, and pets. Still it's not like I've completely thrown
                        away the idea of heading once more to the City of Sin, however next time, I'll be sure to
                        continue avoiding the gambling sections in fear of losing any extra money.
